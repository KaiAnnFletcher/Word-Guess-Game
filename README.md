# Word-Guess-Game
Assignment 3

The purpose of this game is to guess the surnames of some very famous classical composers.

Hit any letter key to begin the round.

You have a total of 8 guesses before your chances expire.

If you exhaust all of your chances before guessing the correct name,you lose the round and the loss counter registers a loss (your number of losses will go up with each loss registered). The game then automatically moves you to the next round after each loss.

If you guess correctly, your number of wins will go up. The game will automatically move you to the next round also after each win.
